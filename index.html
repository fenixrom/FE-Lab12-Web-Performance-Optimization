# Web Performance Statistic

Page speed is one of the most overlooked and yet most important factors in customer attention, retention, and ultimately, converting browsers to buyers.
Ensuring that you’re taking measures to increase page speed or reduce lag can be the difference between failure and success.

## Unhappy users

- 47% of consumers expect a web page to load in 2 seconds or less;
- 73% of mobile internet users have come across a website that was too slow;
- 79% of shoppers who are dissatisfied with site performance say they're less likely to purchase from the same site again;
- 4% of people have thrown their phone while using a slow mobile site

# How fast is fast?

- **< 100ms** feels instantaneous
- **< 300ms** noticeable but still fast
- **< 1000ms** computer is working
- **+1s** mental context switch start
- **+10s** I’ve got better things to do...

###DNS (Domain Name System) resolution 

Time to map the domain name (www.google.com) to an IP address. It can be faster than tenths of a second.

---

###TCP connection

Time to open a connection to the server and get an acknowledgement.
Before the real, encrypted communication between the client and server starts, they perform what is called the "TLS handshake".

# Network stages in Chrome Dev Tools

The **DOMContentLoaded** event is fired when the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading.

A very different event **load** should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page.

# Constructing the Object Model. DOM

Before the browser can render the page it needs to construct the DOM and CSSOM trees.



---



### Simple DOM example:

``` html
<html>
    <head>
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
        <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <title>Critical Path</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello <span>web performance</span> students!</p>
        <div><img src="awesome-photo.jpg"></div>
    </body>
</html>
```



---

# Constructing the Object Model. CSSOM

Before the browser can render the page it needs to construct the DOM and CSSOM trees.

“CSS Object Model”, or CSSOM for short:

.img-wrap-80[![DOM example screenshot](assets/img/cssom-tree.png)]



---


layout: false


# Render-tree construction, Layout, and Paint

All the steps the browser went through:

- Process HTML markup and build the DOM tree.
- Process CSS markup and build the CSSOM tree.
- Combine the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree.
- Run layout on the render tree to compute geometry of each node.
- Paint the individual nodes to the screen.

# Render Blocking CSS



---



- By default, CSS is treated as a render blocking resource.
- Media types and media queries allow us to mark some CSS resources as non-render blocking.
- All CSS resources, regardless of blocking or non-blocking behavior, are downloaded by the browser.



---



CSS is a render blocking resource, get it down to the client as soon and as quickly as possible to optimize the time to first render.

The experience on the right is often referred to as a “Flash of Unstyled Content” (FOUC).

.columns[.col-50[.img-wrap-60[
    ![NYT with css](assets/img/css-render-blocking-with-css.png)
    ]].col-50[.img-wrap-60[
    ![NYT without css](assets/img/css-render-blocking-without-css.png)
]]]



---



### Use CSS media queries for responsiveness!

CSS “media types” and “media queries” allow us to address use-cases when the page is being printed, or being projected onto a large monitor:

``` html
    <link href="style.css"    rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="style.css"    rel="stylesheet" media="screen">
    <link href="portrait.css" rel="stylesheet" media="orientation:portrait">
    <link href="print.css"    rel="stylesheet" media="print">
```



---

layout: false



# Adding Interactivity with JavaScript


When the HTML parser encounters a script tag, it pauses its process of constructing the DOM and yields control over to the JavaScript engine; once the JavaScript engine has finished running, the browser then picks up from where it left off and resumes the DOM construction.

- executing our inline script blocks DOM construction, which will also delay the initial render.
- the browser will delay script execution until it has finished downloading and constructing the CSSOM, and while we’re waiting, the DOM construction is also blocked.
- in the case of an external JavaScript file the browser will also have to pause and wait for the script to be fetched from disk, cache, or a remote server.



---

# Adding Interactivity with JavaScript


Adding the async keyword to the script tag tells the browser that it should not block the DOM construction while it waits for the script to become available - this is a huge performance win!

# Optimizing the Critical Rendering Path



---



No CSS, no JavaScript, or other types of resources ([Demo](https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/basic_dom_nostyle.html))

.small[
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Critical Path: No Style</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello <span>web performance</span> students!</p>
    <div><img src="awesome-photo.jpg"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```]

.img-wrap-60[![](assets/img/analysis-dom.png)]





---



The same page but with an external CSS file ([Demo](https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/analysis_with_css.html)):

.small[
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello <span>web performance</span> students!</p>
    <div><img src="awesome-photo.jpg"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```]

.img-wrap-80[![](assets/img/analysis-dom-css.png)]



---



Let’s add an extra JavaScript file ([Demo](https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/analysis_with_css_js.html)):

.small[
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello <span>web performance</span> students!</p>
    <div><img src="awesome-photo.jpg"></div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```]

.img-wrap-80[![](assets/img/analysis-dom-css-js.png)]



---



We can add the “async” attribute to the script tag to unblock the parser ([Demo](https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/analysis_with_css_js_async.html)):

.small[
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello <span>web performance</span> students!</p>
    <div><img src="awesome-photo.jpg"></div>
    <script src="app.js" async></script>
  </body>
</html>
```]

.img-wrap-80[![](assets/img/analysis-dom-css-js-async.png)]



---



Let’s say the CSS stylesheet was only needed for print ([Demo](https://googlesamples.github.io/web-fundamentals/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/analysis_with_css_nb_js_async.html)):

.small[
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
    <link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" media="print">
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello <span>web performance</span> students!</p>
    <div><img src="awesome-photo.jpg"></div>
    <script src="app.js" async></script>
  </body>
</html>
```]

.img-wrap-80[![](assets/img/analysis-dom-css-nb-js-async.png)]

### The general steps to optimize

- Analyze and characterize your critical path: number of resources, bytes, length.
- Minimize number of critical resources: eliminate them, defer their download, mark them as async, etc.
- Optimize the order in which the remaining critical resources are loaded: you want to download all critical assets as early as possible to shorten the critical path length.
- Optimize the number of critical bytes to reduce the download time (number of roundtrips).


---


###Application shell

The minimal HTML, CSS and JavaScript powering the user interface. 
This should load fast and be cached — and once loaded, dynamic content can populate your view. 

.img-wrap-60[![](assets/img/app-shell.jpeg)]

Include minimal required CSS styles inline in a **style** tag within the document  **head** to provide a fast first paint of the application shell. Load the main styles asynchronously by the JavaScript.

[Aplication shall](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/architecture/app-shell)

---


### Combine javascript and css files

Combining some of your CSS or JS files into one file substantially reduces the amount of time it takes to load your web pages because you are reducing the amount of things the web browser has to load before displaying your page.

.columns[.col-50[
  ![](assets/img/waterfall.png)
].col-50[
  ![](assets/img/combine-js.png)
]]


---


###Javascript files splitting

Loading the code a user needs upfront reduces network transmission & JavaScript parse/compile times. 
Non-critical resources can then be lazily loaded as needed. 
Additionally vendor libraries and common scripts could be cached by browser while navigating though site pages.

.img-wrap-60[![](assets/img/code-splitting.png)]

- a **vendor** chunk contained libraries (jquery, lodash, react, etc)
- an **entry** chunk which contained a majority of the code required to render the app (i.e the main shell of the page) 
- **async** route chunks which contained code pertaining to individual routes 


---


###Lower JavaScript boot-up time with code splitting

JavaScript is your most expensive asset. On mobile, if you're sending down large bundles of JavaScript, it can delay how soon your users are able to interact with your user interface components.

.img-wrap-60[![](assets/img/js-processing.png)]

After the script was downloaded, a JavaScript engine then parse that code, compile it and execute it.

# Text compression with GZIP

- GZIP performs best on text-based assets: CSS, JavaScript, HTML
- All modern browsers support GZIP compression and will automatically request it
- Your server needs to be configured to enable GZIP compression
- Some CDNs require special care to ensure that GZIP is enabled

# Image optimization

### Downloaded assets size by Content-Type

According to statistic, images make up on average 54% of a total webpage’s weight.

.img-wrap-60[![](assets/img/average-image-size-on-web.png)]

So when it comes to optimizing site, images is the first place you should start! It’s more important than scripts and fonts. 



---



### Eliminating and replacing images

- Eliminate unnecessary image resources
- Leverage CSS3 effects where possible
- Combine multiple images into a single sprite 

.columns[.col-50[
  ![](assets/img/sprite-web.png)
].col-50[
  ![](assets/img/sprite-nav.png)
]]

[Sprite Generator](https://spritegen.website-performance.org/)

---



### Vector vs. Raster images

- Vector images are ideal for images that consist of geometric shapes
- Vector images are zoom and resolution-independent
- Raster images should be used for complex scenes with lots of irregular shapes and details

.columns[.col-50[.img-wrap-80[![vector-zoom](assets/img/vector-zoom.png)]
].col-50[.img-wrap-80[![raster-zoom](assets/img/raster-zoom.png)]
]]



---


### Optimizing vector images

- SVG is an XML-based image format
- SVG files should be minified to reduce their size
- SVG files should be compressed with GZIP

```html
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
  <!-- Generator: Adobe Illustrator 17.1.0, SVG Export Plug-In . SVG Version: 6.00 Build 0)  -->
  <svg version="1.2" baseProfile="tiny" id="Layer_1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
     x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 612 792" xml:space="preserve">
  <g id="XMLID_1_">
    <g>
      <circle fill="red" stroke="black" stroke-width="2" stroke-miterlimit="10" cx="50" cy="50" r="40"/>
    </g>
  </g>
  </svg>
```



---



### Optimizing raster images

- A raster image is a grid of pixels
- Each pixel encodes color and transparency information
- Image compressors use a variety of techniques to reduce the number of required bits per pixel to reduce file size of the image

.img-wrap-80[![](assets/img/artifacts.png)]


---



### Delivering scaled image assets

- Delivering scaled assets is one of the simplest and most effective optimizations
- Pay close attention to large assets as they result in high overhead
- Reduce the number of unnecessary pixels by scaling your images to their display size

.img-wrap-80[![](assets/img/unnecessary-pixels.png)]


One of the simplest and most effective image optimization techniques is to ensure that we are not shipping any more pixels than needed to display the asset at its intended size in the browser

- 16,100 pixels x 4 bytes = 64,400 bytes
- 64,400 bytes / 1024 = 62.9 KB

---



### Selecting the right image format

- Start by selecting the right universal format: GIF, PNG, JPEG
- Experiment and select the best settings for each format: quality, palette size, etc.
- Consider adding WebP (Chrome, Opera, Android - developed by Google) and JPEG XR (IE - developed by Microsoft) assets for modern clients

.img-wrap-70[![](assets/img/image-format-tree.png)]

---

###Data URIs

You don't have to link to an external image file when using an img element in HTML, or declaring a background-image in CSS. 
You can embed the image data directly into the document with data URIs. 
It will increase the page size but will prevent additional request for the image file to the server.

```html
<img width="16" height="16" alt="star" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhEAAQAMQAAORHHOVSKudfOulrSOp3WOyDZu6QdvCchPGolfO0o/XBs/fNwfjZ0frl3/zy7////wAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAkAABAALAAAAAAQABAAAAVVICSOZGlCQAosJ6mu7fiyZeKqNKToQGDsM8hBADgUXoGAiqhSvp5QAnQKGIgUhwFUYLCVDFCrKUE1lBavAViFIDlTImbKC5Gm2hB0SlBCBMQiB0UjIQA7" />
```
```css

# Webfont optimization

### Embeding font in a different formats

The **src** descriptor tells a browser where to get a font file.
If you list multiple formats, modern browsers will pick the first format they support.

The bulletproof @font-face syntax has a coverage for all browsers.
.columns[.col-50[
The bulletproof syntax:
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Elena;
  src: url(elena.eot?#iefix) format("embedded-opentype"),
       url(elena.woff2) format("woff2"),
       url(elena.woff) format("woff"),
       url(elena.otf) format("opentype"),
       url(elena.svg#elena) format("svg");
}
```
].col-50[
The simplified syntax with a locally installed font:
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Elena;
  src: local("Elena"),
       url(elena-regular.woff2) format("woff2"),
       url(elena-regular.woff) format("woff");
}
```
]]

Because most websites no longer support old browsers, a simplified syntax is more prefferable

---

### Font Families

Creating a font family with multiple styles is accomplished by creating an @font-face rule for each style and using the same font-family name.

.columns[.col-50[
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Elena;
  src: url(elena-regular.woff);
  font-weight: normal;
}
@font-face {
  font-family: Elena;
  src: url(elena-bold.woff);
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
].col-50[
```css
p {
  font-family: Elena, serif;
}

p strong {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
]]

Each file could have up to hundrets of kbs so multiple custom fonts on a page could affect page load time. Custom fonts should beused on a page as less as possible.

---

### Font subsetting

Subsetting reduces the number of glyphs in the font to make a smaller file. If the font supports a particular language which is not used on a page then this language should be excluded from a generated font.
The most popular places to download web fonts are:
- [https://www.fontsquirrel.com/](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
- [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)

# HTTP caching

Fetching something over the network is both slow and expensive: large responses require many roundtrips between the client and server, which delays when they are available and can be processed by the browser, and also incurs data costs for the visitor. As a result, the ability to cache and reuse previously fetched resources is a critical aspect of optimizing for performance.

#CDN

A content delivery network is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. 
The goal is to distribute service spatially relative to end-users to provide high availability and high performance. 

.img-wrap-70[![http2](assets/img/cdn.png)]


---


#HTTP/2

The focus of the protocol is on performance; specifically, end-user perceived latency, network and server resource usage. One major goal is to allow the use of a single connection from browsers to a Web site.

.img-wrap-70[![http2](assets/img/http1-vs-http2.png)]


---

#Lighthouse

Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication.
It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more.


.img-wrap-90[![http2](assets/img/audits-tab.png)]

#Used and Unused styles

The Coverage tab in Chrome DevTools can help you find unused JavaScript and CSS code. Removing unused code can speed up your page load and save your mobile users cellular data.

.img-wrap-90[![http2](assets/img/coverage-tab.png)]

Shipping unused JavaScript or CSS is a common problem in web development. For example, suppose that you want to use Bootstrap's button component on your page. To use the button component you need to add a link to Bootstrap's stylesheet in your HTML

[Coverrage](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css/reference#coverage)
